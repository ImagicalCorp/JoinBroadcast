# JoinBroadcast

JoinBroadcast is a plugin for PocketMine for broadcasting customised messages when a player joins. It is based on [EvolSoft's](http://github.com/EvolSoft) [CustomAlerts](http://github.com/EvolSoft/CustomAlerts).

## How to install and use this plugin

Simply download this plugin and [compile it into a phar](http://pmt.mcpe.me) and drop it into the plugins folder. It will load automatically. To edit the messages, you will have to edit [Main.php](http://github.com/ImagicalCorp/JoinBroadcast/tree/master/src/ImagicalCorp/Main.php) yourself using a file editor.
