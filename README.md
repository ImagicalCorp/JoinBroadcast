# JoinBroadcast

JoinBroadcast is a plugin for PocketMine for broadcasting customised messages when a player joins. It is based on [EvolSoft's](http://github.com/EvolSoft) [CustomAlerts](http://github.com/EvolSoft/CustomAlerts).

## How to install and use this plugin

Simply download this plugin and [compile it into a phar](http://pmt.mcpe.me) and drop it into the plugins folder. It will load automatically. To edit the messages, you will have to edit [Main.php](http://github.com/ImagicalCorp/JoinBroadcast/tree/master/src/ImagicalCorp/Main.php) yourself using a file editor.

## Notes

This tool was coded and is maintained by [Keith](http://github.com/keithkfng) and the developers of the [Imagical Corporation](http://github.com/ImagicalCorp) mainly for the [Killa Server Network for MCPE](http://www.killasg.ml). This is not a plugin for everyone, this is a plugin for our intended use. Hopefully you find it useful too.
